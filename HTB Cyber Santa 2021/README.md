* Jeopardy style beginner friendly CTF with 5 challenges released daily 
  * Difficuly was progressively ramped up eith each day
* Very enjoyable as I was able to gain exposure to my weaker CTF categories (**Pwning & Reversing**) and solve Day 1 & 2's challenges within the same day  
* The forensics category was the easiest for me, as it was very related to what I do in DFIR
  * Exception was the last day's challenge (**Ho Ho Ho**) when we only had ~3 hours to solve and I did not recognise the Ethereum address 
* Learning Points:
  * Crypto
    * Using **hashpump** to perform the **Hash Length Extension** attack (*Warehouse Maintenance*)
    * Thinking creatively with 2 dictionaries when 2 rounds of encryption with different keys are used (*Meet Me Halfway*)
  * Reversing
    * Using **strace** & **ltrace** at the start to tackle the low-hanging fruits (*Infiltration*)
  * Web
    * Using **beeceptor** to send the admin's cookie to a public website to view its contents (*Toy Workshop*)
  * Pwning
    * Using **pwntools** for scripting and receving input from the remote server (*All challenges*)
  * Forensics
    * Using **olevba** to examine macro-enabled word files and an online VB decompiler for deobfuscation (*Giveaway*)
