* 24 hour Jeopardy CTF where VMs and tools such as Autopsy/FTK Imager/Sqlitestudio were provided for the challenges
* The web/crypto challenges were quite challenging and also had the highest weightage in points
* Good that they allowed us to download the large files (There was one **26GB** file) before the actual competition 
* Enjoyed the series of forensics challenges as it validated my DFIR skills 
* Placed **47/404** which was not too bad considering I was not able to do the higher weightage web/crypto challenges
