We are given a single png file and told to find the first and last name of the man in the image.

Using google's reverse image search, I come across this [link] (https://nypost.com/video/drunk-man-gets-stuck-in-the-mud-while-jogging/) from *nypost* that contains a video with the picture we want but with no mention of the man's name.

I then proceed to search the title of the article ```Drunk man gets stuck in the mud while jogging``` and the first result is a different news article from *yahoo* that contains the man's first and last name: ```Sompong Singita```
