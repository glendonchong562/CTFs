* Jeopardy style beginner friendly CTF with 5 challenges released daily 
  * Difficuly was progressively ramped up eith each day
* Very enjoyable as I was able to gain exporuse to my weaker CTF categories (**Pwning & Reversing**) and solve Day 1 & 2's challenges within the same day  
* The forensics category was the easiest for me, as it was very related to what I do in DFIR
  * Exception was the last day's challenge (**Ho Ho Ho**) when we only had ~3 hours to solve and I did not recognise the Ethereum address 
* Learning Points:
  * Crypto
    * Using hashpump to perform the **Hash Length Extension** attack (*Warehouse Maintenance*)
    * Thinking creatively with 2 dictionaries when 2 rounds of encryption with different keys are used (*Meet Me Halfway*)
  * Reversing
  * Web
  * Pwning
