# CTFs
A compilation of CTF writeups, mostly in the *forensics* and *crypto* categories. Been also spending some time working on the easier *reversing* and *pwning* challenges. I only started doing writeups in Jan 2022, mostly for self-documentation and to consolidate my learning points because CTF challenges can be quite similar in nature.

## List of CTFs I participated in: 

NOTE: There were a couple of CTFs that I attempted but didn't have enough time/couldn't solve any of the challenges so they are not listed here.
