* Day long Jeopardy CTF specifically targeted for Singaporeans
* Challenges were not beginner-friendly and I spent most of my time on the Crypto challenges 
* Only had 5 hours of playable time as it was on a Saturday but it was good exposure to my weaker categories like **Web**/**Rev**
* Got carried for most of the challenges but still good learning journey nonetheless

## Overall Position: 11/130
