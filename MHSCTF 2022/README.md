* Week long Jeopardy CTF with categories like *general* and *programming* that are not common in normal CTFs
* I would say that most of the quesstions are rather beginner friendly and can be solved in 1/2 steps 
* I learned alot during this CTF as I worked in a team and in total we managed to solve every question except one from the crypto category: **Green 2**
* Kudos to the sole challenge organiser who is only a high-school kid and yet managed the CTF intra + sponsors + set all the questions + replied to all the DMs about the questions
