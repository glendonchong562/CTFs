* Jeopardy style beginner friendly CTF targeted at high school students 
* Very enjoyable as the hints were helpful for the more difficult challenges  
* PicoCTF has a tendency to re-use questions that are slightly different as I managed to find write-ups from the past years'
* Nice that Pico also archives all their past year CTF questions for practice purposes
* Learning Points:
  * Crypto
    * The meaning of smooth primes and using Pollard's p − 1 algorithm for smooth primes (**Very Smooth**)
  * Reversing
    * Using Radare2 for debugging (**Keygenme**) 
  * BE
    * Adding padding for the return pointer for 32-bit programs during buffer overflow (**Buffer Overflow 3**)
    * Format string vulnerability using known flag plaintext to determine offset (**Flag Leak**)
  * Forensics
    * Looking for file metadata (SHA-1) hash in torrent traffic in the BT-DHT protocol (**Torrent Analyze**)
