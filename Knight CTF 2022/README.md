* CTF was extended by 3 hours as their infrastructure was down at the start
* More challenges than normal (~85) 
* Categories such as **programming** and **networking** that you don't see in a typical Jeopardy style CTF
* Beginner friendly, especially the challenges with lower points
* Did not have much time to play the CTF (~ 5 hours) so I spent more time on the crypto and forensics categories
* Overall good experience where I learnt more about:
  * Arthimetic operations with singed char (Rev: Flag Checker)
  * Decryption with a private key (Crypto: RSA-One)
  * frackzip to brute force zip password (Forensics: Let's Walk Together)
